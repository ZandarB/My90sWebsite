    <h1>My Top 5 Favorite WipEout Vehicles</h1>
    <ol>
        <li class="myStyle">
            Goteki 45 (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)
        </li>
        <img src="goteki45.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Goteki 45">
        <p>Goteki 45 has had a long history of being my all-time favorite ship brand in WipEout, going all the way back to WipEout Pure, released in 2005. <br>Used to bring the biggest weapons and shields available, they have now forgone these ways to now focus on blisteringly fast acceleration and relatively good shielding.<br> A good way to quickly leave the pack in the early game.</p>

        <li class="mystyle">
            AG Systems (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)
        </li>
        <img src="agsystems.png" width="350" height="200" alt="AG Systems">
        <p>AG-Systems, unlike Goteki 45, have been a somewhat recent addition to my favorite ships. Having learned the power of being a jack of all trades, master of none. <br>Good all-round stats, capable of taking on any other ship and having a decent chance of coming out on top. <br>The pilot's skill is key.</p>

        <li class="mystyle">
            Triakis (Pure)
        </li>
        <img src="triakis.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Triakis">
        <p>Triakis... a tank, in a metaphorical and literal sense, being modeled after a hover tank. <br>This craft can take it and dish it out twice as hard. Containing the famous reverse-inertia deceleration system, which was eventually outlawed and stripped them of their championship win. <br>Cumbersome, but built to last.</p>

        <li class="mystyle">
            Piranha (2048)
        </li>
        <img src="piranha.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Piranha">
        <p>If "Gotta go fast" was a WipEout ship, faster than fast, faster than you. Speed is not the answer but a question, and the answer is yes. <br>Piranha, over their career, have dedicated themselves to being the fastest ships available, and even competition from Icarus isn't enough to surpass them. <br>Boasting unbeatable top-end speed, with some shielding to boot, having low acceleration and a large turning circle.</p>

        <li class="mystyle">
            Qirex Prototype (2048)
        </li>
        <img src="qirexprototype.png" width="350" height="200" alt="Qirex Prototype">
        <p>You want firepower? Qirex has firepower. Sporting an all-new, self-reloading, nigh-infinite ammo minigunâ€”yes, you heard me right, <b>MINIGUN</b>. <br>Also coming with a hearty level of shielding. The Qirex Prototype is the first and only craft to use a singular weapon type, that being its own. <br>Unable to pick up any other weapons and relatively slow to handle, but who needs to handle well when you can destroy all before you with one short burst?</p>
