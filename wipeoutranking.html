        <H1>My top 5 Favorite WipEout Vehicles</H1>
        <ol>
            <b><li>Goteki 45 (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)</li></b>
            <img src="goteki45.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>Goteki45 has had a long history of being my all time favorite ship brand in WipEout, going all the way back to WipEout Pure, released in 2005. Focused on acceleration and Shielding. A good way to quickly leave the pack in the early game.</p>
            
            <b><li>AG Systems (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)</li></b>
            <img src="agsystems.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>AG-Systems, unlike Goteki45 have been a somewhat recent addition to my favorite ships. Having learned the power of being a jack of all trades, master of none. Good all round stats, capable of taking on any other ship and having a decent chance of coming out on top. The Pilots skill is key.</p>

            <b><li>Triakis (Pure)</li></b>
            <img src="triakis.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>Triakis... a tank, in a metaphorical, and a literal sense, being modeled after a hover tank, this craft can take it, and dish it out twice as hard. Containing the famous reverse-inertia deceleration system. Which was eventually outlawed and stripped them of their championship win. Cumbersome, but built to last.</p>

            <b><li>Piranha (2048)</li></b>
            <img src="piranha.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>If "Gotta go fast" was a WipEout ship, faster then fast, faster then you. Speed is not the answer but a question, and the answer is yes. Piranha over their career have dedicated themselves to being the fastest ships available,  and even competition from icarus isn't enough to surpass them. Boasting unbeatable top end speed, with some shielding to boot, having low acceleration and a large turning circle.</p>
        
            <b><li>Qirex Prototype (2048)</li></b>
            <img src="qirexprototype.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>You want firepower? We have firepower. Sporting an all new, self reloading, nigh infinite ammo minigun, yes you heard me right <b>MINIGUN</b>. Also coming with a hearty level of shielding. The Qirex Prototype is the first and only craft to use a singular weapon type, that being its own. Unable to pick up any other weapons and relatively slow to handle, but who needs to handle well when you can destroy all your opponents?</p>
