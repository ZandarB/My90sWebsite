        <H1>My top 5 Favorite WipEout Vehicles</H1>
        <ol>
            <b><li>Goteki 45 (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)</li></b>
            <img src="goteki45.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>Goteki45 has had a long history of being my all time favorite ship brand in WipEout, going all the way back to WipEout Pure, released in 2005. Focused on acceleration and Shielding. A good way to quickly leave the pack in the early game.</p>
            
            <b><li>AG Systems (Pulse/HD Fury/Omega)</li></b>
            <img src="agsystems.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>AG-Systems, unlike Goteki45 have been a somewhat recent addition to my favorite ships. Having learned the power of being a jack of all trades, master of none. Good all round stats, capable of taking on any other ship and having a decent chance of coming out on top. The Pilots skill is key.</p>

            <b><li>Triakis (Pure)</li></b>
            <img src="triakis.png" width="350" height="200"/>
            <p>Triakis... a tank, in a metaphorical, and a literal sense, being modeled after a hover tank, this craft can take it, and dish it out twice as hard. Containing the famous reverse-inertia deceleration system. Which was eventually outlawed and stripped them of their championship win. Slow and cumbersome, but built to last.</p>
